## AI-based paraphrasing

AI-based paraphrasing tool using a transformer model. Paraphrasing is the process of rephrasing a sentence or a text in a way that retains the original meaning but uses different words and structures. The proposed tool utilizes a transformer model, a type of deep learning model, to generate paraphrased sentences. The transformer model is trained on a large corpus of text data using a self-attention mechanism, which allows it to capture long-term dependencies in the input text. The tool takes a sentence as input and generates multiple paraphrased sentences that preserve the meaning and context of the original sentence. The performance of the tool is evaluated using standard metrics, and the results demonstrate that the proposed tool outperforms existing paraphrasing tools. This tool has the potential to assist writers, researchers, and language learners in generating high-quality paraphrased sentences

### About

A paraphrasing tool is a software tool that is used to rephrase or rewrite text in a way that retains the original meaning, but uses different words and sentence structures. It works by analyzing the input text and generating new versions of the same text, which can be useful for simplifying and clarifying complex or technical language, and provide fluency and standard feel to the input text.
Creating a paraphrasing tool uses application of AI and NLP technology. The proposed approach uses an amalgamation of data sampling or data variety with a granular fine-tuned Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model.
